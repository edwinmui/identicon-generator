# Identicon Generator
A simple identicon generator that generates an icon based on a given username.

To run, install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

From there, go into the app folder and run `python3 identicon.py`, after which you will be prompted to input your username. From there, it will generate your identicon!

Example:

<img width="346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/edwinmui/identicon-generator/assets/47285957/264606ca-414c-4542-811d-54d7b4ddb5a6">


You can see the identicon it generated for you outside of the app folder in the main directory, saved as a png. Enjoy!

### Options
`--grid-size n` argument, where n is any integer >= 7; control the pixel length of your identicon
